# Knapsack Problem solving using Archimedes Optimization Algorithm
Archimedes Optimization Algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by an interesting law of physics Archimedesâ€™ Principle. It imitates the principle of buoyant force exerted upward on an object, partially or fully immersed in fluid, is proportional to the weight of the displaced fluid.
for more information check [the article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-020-01893-z/).

Here the binary knapsack problem was implemented using the Archimedes optimization algorithm.
The program has written in Python. The files of this program are:
- knapsack.py
> The knapsack module defines the initial conditions of the problem (the number, mass, and value of the objects and the capacity of the knapsack). 
The functions of generating random answers and calculating the cost function for each answer are in this module.
- AOA.py
> AOA module includes functions related to Archimedes optimization algorithm.
- main.py
> In the main.py file, some conditions required in the problem are defined.



Libraries used in the program:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
